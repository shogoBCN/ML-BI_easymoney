    "During the analysis phase, one of the points that was highlighted is that there is a problem with the engagement of the current client base. This can be seen in the average amount of products per client on a given month, which right now is below one, meaning that there are more customers without products than with products, while at the very least this ratio should be at one. This found issue aligns with the overall current strategy of the company, which is to reorient the commercial focus towards increasing the penetration of the product portfolio in the existing client base to increase profits rather than doing any other campaign for acquiring new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this in mind, in order to recommend products to the current clientbase to maximize profitability out of it, there are several strategies to follow: one could be to place the focus on customers that have no or just one product. Another strategy could be to offer different products to our best clients. From a business point of view seems logic to make an effort on focusing on clients that have zero or one product, this would lead to an increase of the engagement of a very inactive client base which has larger potential benefit, not only in terms of customers that can be targetted but also for long term prospects. Prior to jump into fancy Machine Learning models, an attempt should be made at manually characterize these customers and understand which products to offer them, as relevant information is already available from the analysis phase. Once this manual approach has been understood, it can be constrasted with results from a Machine Learning model that would yield probabilities of purchase for this manually chosen customers. This would set the ground for future improvement, tuning and scale up of models that can help the company to become data driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will focus on the practical implementation of some of the aforemetioned ideas: manual selection of customers having the target of the company in mind, evaluation of the probabilities of these chosen customers to actually purchase the offered product together with the confidence interval associated to this probabilities and finally, the limitations of the model and possible steps towards the future. As a reminder: the Marketing department stated that the current budget allows only 10k mails to be sent, so the goal will be to maximize the potential revenue that can be gained out of them."

In order to select the 10k customers, the first filter will be to check whether they have been active or not in the company application during the last partition of data, as it is believed that hey will be more likely to purchase a product than customers that have not been active. If in the future the way of computing this feature is readjusted and improved, it will only have a beneficial impact on this approach.\n",

From the available data, which includes demographics, products owned and commercial activity, the overall revenue that a client has brought to Easy Money over its time as a client could be taken as a positive indicator of engagement and predisposition of re-engaging. In a similar fashion, from the commercial information, the total number of months of activity in the company's application can be used as a positive indicator of engagement.\n",

The model will be trained with data from the latest list of customers in our database and the target to be predicted will be whether certain profiles of revenue and activity have an EM account or not. In order to add one more dimension to the data from where to draw patterns, age will be added as additional information, it is chosen because it seems the most reliable feature out of the ones available. Once the model meets the quality expectations, which are to be specified later on, the list of selected customers will be fed into the model to predict the probabilities of them purchasing an account or not.\n",

Note: The revenue and months calculated in previous steps will not be used. Because the problem is defined to predict the state during last partition, no info from this last partition will be used to train, test or validate it.\n",

    "Due to the nature of the problem that is being tackled, identifying potential buyers, a false negative is much more damaging to the company than a false positive. The former would mean that the company is not identifying as a buyer someone with higher chances of being so. False positives are also important because they would be targetted as buyers when they won't likely buy anything, but as long as the number of false negatives is reduced to a minimum, a low proportion of false positives is not concerning. In order to evaluate this properly, the target metrics will be recall and accuracy.\n",

As it can be seen, our accuracy is much better than this, for both Training and Testing (93.5% and 93.2% respectively vs 69% baseline). Also, the most important metric in this problem, recall, has the best results of all of them: 96.9% and 96.7%. These are good indicators to move forward.\n",

However, the simplicity of the model needs to be taken into account, specially in the fact that the number and variety of features with which it has been trained was very limited. Therefore, even though the population is large enough so as to allow to obtain statistically relevant results, there might be a problem of underlying undetected overfitting due to the lack of variety in the data."

    "During the discussion of the results obtained it has been highlighted that the seemingly outstanding results are to be considered with caution. The quality of the data that could be used for engineering a dataset to work with was very limited, making it difficult to assemble a model rich on features from where to draw patterns. This scarcity of features yielded very simplistic models that even though show good results, most likely have a problem of underlying overfitting. This conclusion comes from the fact that only total revenue, months of activity and age were used and the most important for predicting the probability of purchasing an EM account was revenue with a weight of 66% over the total, having months of activity a weight of 5%. The debit card approach has more balanced weights - revenue 53%, months 15% but still the same problem arises. \n",

The limitations of the designed models are way too high for them to be a reliable assessment of the data we have. As an additional argument to add, assuming the limitations of the designed models and with the hopes of building a more reliable assessment for future campaigns, the manually calculated window of expected revenue can be used as a ratio to evaluate the success of the campaign. By doing so, the one for debit card seems to be the best of the two analyzed strategies.\n",

The dataset from where it has been drawn is very imbalanced in terms of products and the statistical models built very limited, so these computed rates are no better than calculating the percetage of customers that have the discussed products in the last partition.\n",

Once this issue has been tackle, new possibilities in terms of how to use this data can emerge. Some possible future scenarios could include the automated selection of the customers to send mails to by assignning probabilities of purchase linked to their commercial/demographic profile, thus maximizing the probabilities of actual purchase if compared to a manual selecition of the customers. Another idea for the future could be to build a collaborative filtering model which would help the company understand in more depth which types of products are often purchased together, combining this with a more comprehensive clustering of the client base could allow to make more tailored recommendations to specific groups of customers."
